# CS2Deniz v1.1.0 - The "Automation & Stability" Update

**CS2Deniz v1.1.0** is a major overhaul focused on user experience, advanced humanization, and long-term stability. This version introduces industry-standard automation, ensuring the tool remains functional across game updates without manual intervention.

## 🚀 What's New in 1.1.0?

### 🛠️ **Zero-Touch Setup**
*   **Auto-Prerequisite Installer:** The application now detects if the **.NET 8 Runtime** or the **Undefeated Font** are missing and automatically downloads/installs them for you.
*   **Live Offset Updates:** No more "broken" cheats after a CS2 update. The tool now fetches the latest memory offsets directly from GitHub on every launch.

### 🧠 **Advanced Combat Logic**
*   **WindMouse Humanization:** Aimbot now uses the "WindMouse" algorithm to simulate organic, curved cursor paths, significantly reducing behavioral detection risk.
*   **Dynamic Smoothing & Prediction:** Target leading (prediction) and hit-rate-based smoothing adjustments for a more "legit" feel.
*   **Triggerbot Safety:** Added mid-air checks to prevent "impossible" shots while jumping.

### 👁️ **Visual Enhancements**
*   **Detailed ESP:** New status indicators show if an enemy is **Flashed**, **Scoped**, or **Shifting**.
*   **Weapon Icons:** Real-time weapon icons displayed on the overlay.
*   **Recoil Crosshair:** Accurate visual indicator of where your bullets are actually landing.

### 🌐 **Project Branding**
*   **New Landing Page:** A professional, standalone `index.html` interface for the project.
*   **Dynamic Versioning:** The UI now automatically syncs its versioning with the project assembly metadata.
