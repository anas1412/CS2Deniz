# CS2Deniz v1.2.0 - UI & Responsiveness Overhaul

**CS2Deniz v1.2.0** focuses on polishing the user experience, improving the project's brand presentation, and ensuring a seamless experience across all devices. This version includes a complete UI overhaul for the `index.html` landing page and addresses several key user experience fixes.

## 🚀 What's New in 1.2.0?

### 🎨 **UI/UX Overhaul**
*   **Professional Landing Page:** Introduced a new, fully-featured `index.html` with a sleek, CS2-inspired design and strong marketing focus.
*   **Responsive Design:** The landing page is now fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices, including a functional hamburger menu.
*   **Branding Integration:** Added the official `logo.png` and `favicon.ico` to the website for consistent branding.
*   **Balanced Layout:** Adjusted the feature grid to a 4-column layout for a more balanced and professional look on all screen sizes.

### ⚙️ **Quality of Life & Fixes**
*   **Improved Key-Binding UX:** The interactive configuration menu now provides examples of common keys, making it easier for users to set their preferred keybinds.
*   **Corrected Version Display:** Fixed an issue where the console would display the version as `1.1.0.0` instead of the correct `1.1.0`. The version now correctly reflects the `csproj` metadata.
*   **Mobile Background Fix:** Addressed a rendering issue on mobile where the background image was not scrolling correctly.
*   **Documentation Consistency:**
    *   Added explicit disclaimers about user responsibility and ban risks to `index.html`.
    *   Ensured default keybinds (e.g., **Right Alt** for Triggerbot) are mentioned in all relevant documentation.
