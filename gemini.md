after build you find executable in ./bin/Debug/CS2Deniz.exe


. How to run it
Since this is a cheat/overlay for a game, you must run it with permissions, or it cannot read the game memory.
Open CS2 (the game) and wait for it to load to the menu.
Set the game to Windowed or Fullscreen Windowed (Borderles) mode (Overlays usually don't work in Exclusive Fullscreen).
Go to your bin\Debug\ folder.
Right-click CS2Deniz.exe.
Select Run as Administrator.
